The presented RandomForrest.Rmd script is used to develop a predictive model for the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) of a set of advanced nanomaterials. The data used in the analysis is located in input_file.csv.

The data were collected based on scientific publications. 
The independent variables include the dose (Âµg/mouse), duration of exposure (in days) to the nanomaterial, as well as the aspect ratio (the ratio of length to diameter) and BET_SSA (specific surface area measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method). The dependent variable is DNA damage in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, expressed as the percentage of DNA strand breaks (TDNA%).

In addition to the predictive model, the code includes a multivariate data analysis essential for understanding the data structure.
