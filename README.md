<big> **The presented RandomForrest.Rmd script is used to develop a predictive model for the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) of a set of advanced nanomaterials. The data used in the analysis is located in input_file.csv. The code is regularly updated to add further steps of analysis.** <big/>

The data were collected based on scientific publications. 
The independent variables include the dose (Âµg/mouse), duration of exposure (in days) to the nanomaterial, as well as the aspect ratio (the ratio of length to diameter) and BET_SSA (specific surface area measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method). The dependent variable is DNA damage in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, expressed as the percentage of DNA strand breaks (TDNA%).

**In addition to the predictive model, the code includes a multivariate data analysis essential for understanding the data structure.**

The code is written in a highly versatile manner, facilitating its use with other datasets while maintaining the appropriate structure of the input file.  
The R code requires an input data matrix in .CSV file format, which should be placed in the same directory as the R script file. The decimal separator should be a comma. The matrix should be arranged as follows:
* the first column should contain the names of the compounds,
* the following columns should contain the descriptor values (independent variables),
* the last column should represent the experimental toxicity (dependent variable).
